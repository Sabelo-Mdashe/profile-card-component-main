## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I learnt how to use the nth-child CSS sudo-elements.


```css
span:nth-of-type(even) {
  margin-left: .3em;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to master CSS, I feel like I'm getting better and better after each project.

### Useful resources
